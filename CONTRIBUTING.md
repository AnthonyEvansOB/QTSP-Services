## Contributing via pull request guide

* Create a personal fork of this repository by clicking on the fork button on the top of this page. This will create a copy of this repository in your account.
* Clone the fork on your local machine `git clone "url you just copied"`.
* If you created your fork a while ago be sure to pull upstream changes into your local repository.
* Branch from master and create a new branch to work on using `hotfix/` or `feature/` as the prefix `git checkout -b "feature/<add-your-new-branch-name>"`
* Make necessary changes and commit those changes as needed.
* Push your branch to your own fork on Github, the remote origin.
* From your fork open a pull request in the correct branch and target `master`.

Once the pull request is approved and merged by OBIE you can pull the changes from upstream to your local repo and delete your extra branch(es) if required.
